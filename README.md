# ipcheck_ovh
Script to update my DynHost on OVH

python2 must be installed.

A file named credentials.sh must be put in the same folder as the script and defining the following variables:
HOST=xxx.domain.ext
LOGIN=login_of_the_dynhost_on_ovh
PASSWORD=password_of_the_dynhost_on_ovh

The script has been obtained from https://dev.kprod.net/dns-dynamique-avec-dynhost-ovh and then modified by me.
